"""tactical_extract.py — v6 free-text tactical instructions -> typed items.

The problem this solves: a client's ad-hoc guidance ("buy the bond fund in
tranches", "only add Nasdaq after a 15-20% pullback", "gold below USD 4,000/oz",
"low fees and good liquidity", "what's the impact of rate hikes?") is *varied*
but not *unstructured* — it clusters into four recognisable TYPES, each wanting
different downstream handling. A single free-text box flattens all four into
narrated prose; this module classifies the text into typed slots the engine can
act on, while anything that doesn't classify stays as free-text guidance.

The four types:
  * entry_trigger   — a conditional, monitorable rule (price / valuation level).
                      Feeds a monitoring watchlist (cf. the sibling repo's
                      alerts.py). e.g. "buy gold below $4,000/oz".
  * execution_style — how to build a position: lump sum / tranches (DCA) /
                      initial-then-wait / on-trigger. e.g. "buy in tranches".
  * selection_criteria — screening preferences on the products chosen.
                      e.g. "low fees, good liquidity, good quality".
  * question        — an open question to answer, not an instruction to encode.
                      e.g. "what's the impact of rate-hike expectations?".
  * other           — anything that doesn't classify; kept as free-text guidance.

DISCIPLINE (identical to vision_extract): the LLM only CLASSIFIES and copies the
client's own words / levels — it never invents a threshold, a level, or a number
that the client did not state (threshold is null when unstated). A human reviews
and edits every item before it drives anything. Unlike a scanned statement, the
input here is already text, so a deterministic keyword classifier
(`heuristic_extract`) gives a usable first pass with NO API key — the keyless /
DEMO build still demonstrates the whole extract -> review -> confirm flow.
